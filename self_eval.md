# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
> I feel confident in using built in Ruby methods (8/10) could use more practice
> before it will start to feel natural.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
> Writing simple methods I understand very well. (10/10)
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
> When would the method replace be used? Seems like if your replacing an entire piece of data you could just reassign the variable you call it on.
> Ruby documentation shows the below example:

```
s = 'foo'        # => "foo"
s.replace('bar') # => "bar"
```
> Seems to just be a more complicated way of coding `s = bar`
